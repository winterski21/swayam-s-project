               <p> 3D modelling is a very useful skill, since it can be used for art, movies, tv shows, and the way I use it, in coding games. 3D modelling is most commonly done on blender, however, it can be done on multiple sites. 3D modelling is a very broad topic, but the workflow I use for 3d modelling is: Blocking:
                Blocking is a simple task, where you block out different big sections of your model while ignoring fine details., Detailing: Detailing is the most time consuming task, since it involves modelling the very tiny details, such as screws, bolts, and other aspects of a 3d model , Texturing and Lighting: Texturing and Lighting is a step which involves creating textures in a 3d model, and lighting just lights up the area around it.     </p> </section>
