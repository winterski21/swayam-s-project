      <h2> Closing thoughts </h2>
        <p> Through most of these, you can conclude that, even though I have been learning for quite some time now, I am no-where near perfection. However, that's not my goal, since this hobby is not about perfection, it's about fun. To be honest, my goal in art is just to get better and most importantly (corny but true) to have fun.   </p>
